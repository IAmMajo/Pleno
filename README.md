## About the project
Volunteer organizations face the challenge of efficiently organizing their work and engaging members in the process. They often lack digital tools specifically tailored to their needs, such as meeting scheduling, task coordination, or attendance management. Existing applications tend to be too generic, difficult to use, or insufficient in functionality. This often leads to inefficient processes, communication issues, and wasted time. An innovative solution is needed—one that addresses the specific requirements of these organizations while remaining easily accessible and user-friendly.

Existing solutions in club and event organization, such as Doodle or Trello, offer individual functions like appointment scheduling or task management. However, these platforms lack an integrated set of tools tailored to the specific challenges of volunteer organizations. Moreover, they are often designed for larger companies or individual users, making them less suitable for clubs. In particular, there is no comprehensive solution covering attendance management, protocol creation, and voting processes. This is where "Pleno" comes in, uniting all these aspects in a single platform.

The interdisciplinary project "Pleno" aims to develop an AI-supported platform that simplifies the work of volunteer organizations. The focus is on providing an app that integrates various functions such as meeting scheduling, protocol creation, voting, and carpooling. A central design aspect is user-friendliness, ensuring that even less technically inclined members can use the app with ease. Additionally, the platform offers an administrative app for club managers, enabling role assignment, member management, and club settings adjustment. The development process followed an iterative approach with user tests and feedback loops to optimally tailor the application to the target audience's needs.

The project team developed Android and iOS apps, complemented by a separate administrative app for iPadOS. The technical implementation included developing a QR and numeric code system for attendance registration, as well as AI-based functions for protocol translation. The platform’s design was tested both as a clickable prototype and as a fully functional implementation. Legal requirements were addressed by creating prototype versions of terms and conditions, privacy policies, and an imprint. Additionally, a comprehensive marketing strategy was developed to make the app accessible to potential user groups after project completion.

The further development of "Pleno" offers tremendous potential to support volunteer organizations even more effectively. With added enhancements in the later stages of the project, such as surveys and events, added additional valuable features to the platform. In the long term, functionalities like automatic task distribution, an expanded reporting system, or the integration of third-party services such as calendars or messaging platforms could be implemented. Furthermore, the platform could be more deeply integrated into the volunteer community through workshops and tutorials. Its scalability and adaptability also make it suitable for larger organizations or additional target groups such as non-profit companies.
